How to maintain the VIEW project?

The VIEW project is divided into the webapp and the firefox addon.

The websites for the webapp can be found in /VIEW/src/main/webapp/tmpl
which consists of several java server pages, they are not relevant for 
the addon.

The clientside of the code for the webapp is handled by javascript
with help of jquery, the files are in /VIEW/src/main/webapp/js-lib
They describe what is done with the processed information and annotations
that are directly visible to the client, such as colorize words

Similarly the clientside for the addon is located in 
/VIEW/src/main/resources/firefox-extension/view/chrome/content

Note that Russian topics are prefixed by "rus".
Relevant files are ruswordstress.js, in case the stress marker changes
and sidebar.js in case some features of the FST change.

The serverside is handled by javacode and is doing the "heavy lifting" for
both, the addon and also the webapp.
First the website is tokenized and annotated by the FST analyser.
The annotator files are /VIEW/src/main/java/werti/uima/ae/Vislcg3RusAnnotator.java
and /VIEW/src/main/java/werti/uima/ae/Vislcg3RusAnnotatorWithTrace.java
The annotator with trace contains also the readings that are ruled out by
the constraint grammar.

The enhancer java classes are responsible for the enhancement according to
selected topic. They target only specific POS etc. They can be found in
/VIEW/src/main/java/werti/uima/enhancer/
The relevant ones are all prefixed by Vislcg3Rus.

Before running mccoy for the first time, copy the WERTi mccoy profile to 
your own .mozilla directory.  

- on delos: cp -rp ~adriane/.mozilla/mccoy to ~/.mozilla/mccoy

For each new version:

1. Create the new .xpi file src/main/webapp/firefox-extensions/view-0.NN.xpi 
   (double-check that you have all the right version numbers in install.rdf).

   If you're using the most recent version from src/main/resources without 
   modifications, this is the file automatically generated as 
   src/main/webapp/firefox-extension/view.xpi.  When you've
   successfully verified everything, copy the new .xpi file to
   src/main/webapp/firefox-extension/view-latest.xpi so that it's also the
   version that's downloaded for new installs.
2. Edit update.rdf.dev in src/main/webapp/firefox-extension:
   Copy the previous <r:li> block and update the version number, the
   min/max firefox versions as needed, update the download link (to the 
   view-0.NN.xpi link), and add the sha256sum of the new .xpi file.
3. Copy update.rdf.dev to update.rdf.  (mccoy destroys the formatting, so it's
   a lot easier to edit update.rdf.dev each time and let mccoy reformat
   update.rdf as it desires.)
4. Run ~adriane/mccoy/mccoy (currently on delos) and enter the password in 
   ~adriane/mccoy/view-key.txt
5. Select WERTi Extension.
6. Click on "Sign" and select the updated update.rdf file.
7. When you click "Open", update.rdf will be updated in place and mccoy won't 
   display any further information.

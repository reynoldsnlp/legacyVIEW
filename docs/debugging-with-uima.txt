The UIMA documentAnalyzer can also be used from the command line.
target/classes and everything that is in WERTi/WEB-INF/lib *have* to be in the
classpath. From WERTi's root, you can issue:

    for i in target/WERTi/WEB-INF/lib/*jar; do
        CLASSPATH=$i:$CLASSPATH;
    done;
    export CLASSPATH=target/classes:$CLASSPATH

to update your classpath. The documentAnalyzer is then run via the following
shell command (adding log4j properties too, since you probably want to have
logging output:)

    java -Dwerti.serverProperties=test.properties \
         -Dlog4j.configuration=test-log4j.properties \
        org.apache.uima.tools.docanalyzer.DocumentAnalyzer

test.properties can be substituted for another properties file that defines
different defaults for the relevant runtime variables.

This folder contains files not open for public.
Make sure that the *.p12 file inside this folder is never committed to
the repository. (security issue)

When you work on this project please add the following files manually:

*.p12 (private key for service account)

The following files need to be changed eventually:

identity-toolkit-java-master/gitkit-server-config.json (server configuration file)
identity-toolkit-java-master/templates/gitkit-widget.html (client configuration file)

Make sure that in the server configuration file
the  "serviceAccountPrivateKeyFile": is specified
so that "INSERT/PATH/TO/PRIVATEKEY" is the full path to the
private key starting with "/" and ending with the *.p12 file name.

For client configuration go to 
https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/quickstart/java

and do step 2, 5. if neccessary (widget.html is actually gitkit-widget.html)

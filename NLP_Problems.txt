# Passives

## Stanford Parser/tagger problems

### Misparsing of passive verbs with prepositions

- The man was peed on by the dog.
- The man was barked at by the dog.

On/at seem to get tagged as IN sometimes, which will confuse the parser into
falsely believing by is the IN's dependent. Right now I can't think of any
solution, except maybe training a new model, or hardcoding hideous exceptions
to deal with it in a rule-based fashion.

### Probably wrong parse tree with intransitive matrix verbs

- The man who was bitten by the dog stank.

(TODO) This sees to cause the parser some confusion, but I haven't yet fully
checked it, so probably need to do that before starting to whine about it.

### Problematic who elision in relative clauses to NNPs

- Eric, who was bitten by a dog, was shot in the head.

This'll cause Eric & his relative clause to be rendered as "Eric the dog bit"
which is wrong. We need to insert whom in NNPs. In fact, eliding who fully is
probably a bad idea anyway.

### Agent/patient detection is a bit off.

- He was found by his colleagues to be a handsome man.

This renders as "His colleagues to be a handsome man find him" instead of "His
colleagues find him to be a handsome man." The problem is that "His colleagues
to be a handsome man" is erroneously getting flagged as a constituent. This is
also due to the nature of the dependency parse Stanford gives us. "is found [â€¦]
to be a handsome man" should be the actual verb phrase here. Right now, we're
overgenerating. WERTi should detect that these kinds of phrases just aren't
gonna happen for now.

## Grammatical transformation problems

### Passive infinitivals

- Ed wanted to be convinced by Sarah.
- Ed wanted Sarah to convince him.

Is there a sufficiently exploitable regularity here? Is it worth doing these
(i.e. are they common enough?)

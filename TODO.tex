\title{VIEW TODO List}
\author{The VIEW Developers}
\maketitle



The name in braces after a task is the person who is currently working on it.

\section{Important}

\begin{itemize}
\item finish adding user tracking (Marion) 
\item verify bugs reported on this list and delete them from this list if they are outdated/ already fixed
\item load models on server startup instead of during the first request
\item share models between threads wherever possible
\item find a more efficient way to turn the annotation stored in the CAS into HTML code
\item React smart on encountering html-entities
\item Improve tagger:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item daemonize
	\item test multi-language stuff
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Bugs}

\begin{itemize}
\item fix bug in \verb+werti.uima.ae.OpenNlpSentenceDetector+ (lines 92-105) when using `Phrasal Verbs' topic
\item \verb+HTMLContentTypeAnnotator+ can only handle pages with a \verb+<body>+ element, no \verb+<frame>+s
\item Don't screw up on html tags with \verb+&lt;+ and \verb+&gt;+ entities instead of \verb+<+ and \verb+>+.
\item \verb+WERTi.java+ does not respect \verb+this.server+; line 179
\item does the HTML annotation really need the tag-name field?
\item Possible bug with premature \verb+.next()+ call on iterators in \verb+LingPipeTagger+ and others (first sentence is likely not considered)
\item the webapp sometimes breaks the CSS of the enhanced page, and sometimes tokens get \verb_class="wertiviewhit"_, but no color
\end{itemize}

\section{Wishlist}

\begin{itemize}
\item enhance dynamically added web page content to support web applications like Moodle Chat\footnote{There are existing JavaScript implementations to detect modifications of the DOM tree: \url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900151/} and \url{http://prototypejs.org/doc/latest/dom/Event/observe/}}
\item make terminology consistent in the code: `topic' vs. `activity'
\item new topic ``word frequency'': color-code the frequency of each word like in a heat-map
\item put the lingpipe sentence boundary detector to use (we'd have to re-implement its API for this)
\item implement HTML parser\footnote{\url{http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/}}
\item Implement TreeTagger
\item Use HTML entities in sentence boundary followers (like, for " or similar)
\item Internationalize the exceptions, logging, whole application following \url{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/intl/index.html}
\item Interactive Passivator
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item multiple choice and practice:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item accept answers as correct based on whether they are grammatically correct, not whether they appear in the original text
		\begin{itemize}
		\item grammatically correct alternatives that were not in the original web page text are currently marked as incorrect answers
		\item if the original web page text contains errors, these are currently marked as correct answers
		\item account for differences between Rechtschreibreformen in German (e.g., accept ``muss'' as correct even if the original was ``muß'')
		\end{itemize}
	\item determiners (and probably other topics): display mc/fib boxed in front of nouns that originally had no determiner and make the empty string an option that the user can choose/enter
	\item display extra buttons to enter non-ASCII characters into the fib box
	\end{itemize}
\item more languages and topics:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item German: articles (not determiners)
	\item German: gender of nouns
	\item German: haben/sein for past perfect
	\item French: avoir/être for past perfect
	\item English passives:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item word order variations, heavy NP shift
		\item identifying agent by-phrases
		\item re-write some of the existing unreadable code
		\end{itemize}
	\item German: Konjunktiv II only (Adriane has implemented this in the `konjexp' branch)
	\item German: connectives (Zeeshan Mustafa)
	\item English: verb tenses (Lilyana Nikolova)
	\item Russian: pronoun inflection
	\end{itemize}
\item user interface:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item better bug report/ feedback form (Caroline)
	\item track and log user activity, user accounts (Marion, in the `user-accounts' branch)
		\begin{itemize}
		\item data sharing between accounts: students can share their statistics with teacher
		\end{itemize}
	\item let user choose which parts of the page to enhance
		\begin{itemize}
		\item similar to selection tool in Firebug
		\end{itemize}
	\item integrate into Moodle (?)
	\item add an ``exam mode'':
		\begin{itemize}
		\item no immediate feedback to user input
		\item when finished with the whole web page, user submits answers (using e.g., toolbar button)
		\item delayed feedback on single errors
		\item overall score/ grade (option to save in user account, share with teacher)
		\end{itemize}
	\item printer-friendly versions of enhanced pages \textit{or} enhance print previews
	\item VIEW app for smart phones
	\item find a way to enhance words inside hyperlinks for the click activity (important for Wikipedia)
	\end{itemize}
\item perform experiments in a class setting:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Canadian learners of German: Konunktiv II (Ulf Schuetze)
	\item Spanish learners of English: gerunds/to-infinitives (Martí Quixal)
	\item American learners of Spanish: business vocabulary (Martí Quixal)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
